## ðŸš— Fuel Efficiency Predictor (iOS)

This is an iOS app built with **SwiftUI** and **TensorFlow Lite** that predicts a vehicleâ€™s fuel efficiency (MPG - miles per gallon) based on user input. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to estimate MPG using features like:

* Cylinders
* Displacement
* Horsepower
* Weight
* Acceleration
* Model Year
* Origin (USA, Europe, Japan)

### ðŸ§  Features

* Built using **SwiftUI** for modern UI design
* Integrates a **TensorFlow Lite** regression model
* Real-time prediction based on user input
* Includes preprocessing logic like one-hot encoding and normalization

### ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

* Swift & SwiftUI
* TensorFlow Lite
* CoreML (optional integration support)
